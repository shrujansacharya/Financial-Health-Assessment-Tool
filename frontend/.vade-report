# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics in the Financial Health Assessment Tool React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package (v1.6.1) to the project dependencies
- Updated package.json and package-lock.json accordingly

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.tsx**: 
  - Added import statement: `import { Analytics } from "@vercel/analytics/react"`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the main div, just after the footer
  - This ensures web analytics tracking is enabled throughout the entire application

## Implementation Details

Since this is a React application built with Vite, I followed the recommended approach for React applications:
- Used the `@vercel/analytics/react` package
- Placed the `<Analytics />` component in the root App component
- The Analytics component wraps the tracking script and provides seamless integration with React

## Verification

- ✅ Build completed successfully (`npm run build`)
- ✅ No linting errors introduced in App.tsx
- ✅ Package dependencies properly installed
- ✅ Lock file updated correctly

## Next Steps

Once deployed to Vercel:
1. The app will automatically start tracking visitors and page views
2. Analytics data can be viewed in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab
3. A Fetch/XHR request to `/_vercel/insights/view` should be visible in the browser's Network tab

## Notes

The implementation is minimal and non-invasive:
- No breaking changes to existing functionality
- The Analytics component is lightweight and loads asynchronously
- Follows Vercel's best practices for React applications
- Compatible with the existing project structure and build configuration
