# Vercel Web Analytics Implementation

## Summary
Successfully implemented Vercel Web Analytics for the Financial Health Assessment Tool React application.

## Changes Made

### 1. Installed Dependencies
- Added `@vercel/analytics` package to the project
- Updated `package.json` and `package-lock.json` with the new dependency

### 2. Modified Files
- **src/App.tsx**: 
  - Added import for `Analytics` component from `@vercel/analytics/react`
  - Added `<Analytics />` component at the end of the App component, just before the closing div

## Implementation Details

This is a React + Vite application, so I followed the create-react-app/React implementation pattern from the Vercel Analytics documentation:

1. Imported the Analytics component: `import { Analytics } from '@vercel/analytics/react'`
2. Added the component to the JSX tree in the main App component

The Analytics component is placed at the root level of the application, which ensures it will track page views across the entire application.

## What's Next

After deploying to Vercel:
1. Enable Web Analytics in the Vercel dashboard (Analytics tab → Enable)
2. Deploy the application using `vercel deploy`
3. View analytics data in the Vercel dashboard under the Analytics tab

## Notes
- The build completed successfully
- No new linting errors were introduced by these changes
- The implementation follows Vercel's recommended patterns for React applications
- Once deployed, the Analytics component will automatically track visitors and page views
